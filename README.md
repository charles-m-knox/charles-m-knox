# Charles M. Knox

Welcome. I am a senior software engineer with >12 years of professional experience. I hold a Bachelor's of Science degree in Physics from [Arizona State University](https://asu.edu), and I worked at [Intel](https://intel.com) in a variety of roles for about 8 years, and then worked with a variety of VC-backed tech startups as well as other firms.

I am a Linux enthusiast and write software in Go, TypeScript, and Python, and dabble in other languages from time to time. I've done DevOps roles and software engineering roles for the majority of my career.

## Software projects

Here's a growing list of software projects I've either written, forked, or have made contributions to. This list isn't complete and currently covers only very recent items.
